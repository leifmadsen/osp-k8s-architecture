# Test validation for PR 208

Temporary(?) directory to prove out changes in PR 208 doesn't cause regressions
to values.yaml as currently generated by CIFMW.

## Testing output

```bash
cd ~/src/github.com/openstack-k8s-operators/architecture
kustomize build lib/testing/nncp/with-default-routes
kustomize build lib/testing/nncp/with-empty-route
```

You can perform a comparison and see that both builds result in a generated
manifest for NNCP component.

In the output, you can see that a values.yaml with defined default routes (as
currently generated by CIFMW) continues to work as expected, even with the
simplified NNCP component changes as proposed in PR 208.
