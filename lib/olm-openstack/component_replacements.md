## Component olm-openstack replacement requirements

Each component expects a set of ConfigMap parameters to be passed to it so that
manifests can be generated by kustomize.

The component expects the parameters to be set in a corresponding local
ConfigMap in the overlay. Defaults are generally not provided by the component,
and errors will be thrown if the expected parameter is missing when building
the manifests with kustomize.

| ConfigMap source name | Parameter field path |
| ----------- | ---------- |
| olm-values | data.openstack-operator-image |
